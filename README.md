# Price Update: Overview
Price Update helps you keep track of products you want to buy!
# Usage
Right now, Price Update uses Selenium to do web scrapping. I specifically used class names to define tags.
To start, open a .txt file and write in this **exact order**: link, class name for the price, class name for the product.
#### All information on the .txt file should be separated by "," and encapsulated in "".
#### Example: `"google.com","finalPrice","name"`
After that, point to Price Update where the file is, and let it do the rest!
# To-do list
